Hi there! I'm a PhD student at KTH in Stockholm, working with Prof. [Florian T. Pokorny](https://www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/) and [Xianyi Cheng](https://xianyicheng.github.io/) at Duke. I hold an M.Sc. from ETH Zürich and a B.Sc. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My résumé is available [here](assets/pdf/Yifei_CV.pdf).

My research asks the question of what is the underlying principle of manipulation robustness, and how to achieve human- and animal-level manipulation robustness on robots. To address this, I focus on problems at the intersection of dexterous, non-prehensile manipulation,  tool use and deformable object manipulation. My approaches draw on techniques such as computational co-design, energy-based caging methods, and reinforcement learning.

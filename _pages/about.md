Hi there! I'm a second-year PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm under the supervision of Asoc. Prof. [Florian T. Pokorny](https://www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/). My research is supported by the European Commission project [SoftEnable](https://softenable.eu/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. from ETH Zurich and my B. Sc. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).
